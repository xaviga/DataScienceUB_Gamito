In order to use the notebook concerning "Data Gathering" we need to have the following python packages installed

    + lxml #pip install lxml
    + cssselect #pip install cssselect
    + pyquery #pip install pyquery
    + selenium #pip install selenium
    + pymongo #pip install pymongo

Additionally, we are using mongoDB database. You can find the community server files at

Finally, for the automation tools for scraping we will need Mozilla Firefox installed. The driver to programatically control Firefox is called 'geckodriver' and can be found at https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases.
